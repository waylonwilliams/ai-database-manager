# motivation

I was previously using MySQL workbench for managing databases used in my personal projects. However, for the small amount of data and tables I am managing, something as thorough as MySQL Workbench is unnecessary, slow, and ugly. I wanted to make a database manager that has a quicker boot, faster queries for small data management, nicer styling, and no restrictions on database operations.
